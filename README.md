# GeforceExperienceKipper
Stop Geforce Experience from auto updating!

A simple launcher for Geforce Experience that prevents GE from automatically updating.

# Always start it up
Don't start GE using the default launcher. Always use this to launch it. That way you avoid unnesscary updates.

# Why use it?
"Nvidia’s now forcing you to log in to use GeForce Experience, via Facebook, Google, or an Nvidia account tied to your email address. That burns—especially after you’ve already forked over hundreds of dollars for a GeForce graphics card—but fortunately, the company isn’t locking its vaunted Game Ready drivers behind GFE registration as previously threatened. When asked if there are plans to do so in the future, an Nvidia spokesperson said, “You can still get the drivers outside of GFE.”
